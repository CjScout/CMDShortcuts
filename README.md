# WindowsCMDShortcuts

This is simple windows batch script to automate many smaller tasks such as flushing the DNS Resolver cache or checking for disk errors.

The script is divided into 3 master catagories with each function under one of them.

Note: All outputs go to command line unless otherwise noted, in which case they will be stored in a file called output.txt in the System32 folder.
